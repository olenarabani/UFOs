# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
 
 Dana wanted  to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a table. And wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

##Summary:

**Drawback:**

When user use filter needs to know special date for input. 

1.In the "date" filter button doesn't have calendar options. 
2.In the "Enter city"  and "Enter State" buttons does not have autofill options
3.Web page doesn't have relation for different devices, just works for  computer's browser.
4.Doesn't have translete options for different langueges.

**Recommendations:**

If all drawback will be elemenated UFOs web page will looks better and will give users more options.
